# Top Down Power Up
You thought your favorite *FIRST*<sup>®</sup> Robotics Competition game couldn't get better—but you were wrong! Introducing TOP-DOWN *FIRST* POWER-UP, (hopefully) 100% bug-free!  

To play, drive your robot around and collect Power Cubes from the field or the portals to deposit onto your switch, your opponent's switch, and the scale. For each second that a switch or scale is tipped towards your side, you receive a point. The game lasts for 150 seconds, and in the first 15 seconds, you receive double points. A video with a good explanation of how the original game works is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZbdwYiCY74
